# Pedestrian Detection System

## Description
This project aims to design and implement a software system for pedestrian detection among other moving objects. The system's primary goal is to identify pedestrians in real-time video streams or images, making it a valuable tool for various applications, such as traffic management, surveillance, and autonomous vehicles.

In this project, an implementation of the human detection software system among the moving objects of the scene is presented. The method utilizes HOG descriptors, adaptive filtering, and support vector machine classifiers, with special emphasis on head and shoulder information for accurate detection. The method has been tested on a standard dataset, and its results have been comprehensively analyzed.
